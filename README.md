# Controlling Mouse Movements Using hand Gesture(computer vision/opencv)


This project presents a vision-based interface for controlling a computer mouse via hand gestures.
The project is designed to enable non-contact human-computer interaction.
This can be done byhand detection, gesture recognition&hand tracking that can move freely in the field of view of a moving camera system. By applying vision technology and controlling the mouse by natural hand gestures, we can reduce the work space required.
